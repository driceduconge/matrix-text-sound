# About
This is an under-development software to make music using text input, for now I'm starting with a basic 4/4 grid in which 1 beat = 1 letter and there would be 2 voices, controlled by different oscillators. The future goal is to make it evolve into a word-based music editor. This way one can write poetry/novels and then automatically convert it into a soundscape.
# Tools used
Programmed in Kotlin
with OPENRNDR for all the display features
with Minim for everything audio-related
